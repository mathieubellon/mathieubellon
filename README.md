### **👋 Hi there**

I’m **Mathieu Bellon**, a **full-stack developer** and **open-source enthusiast** with a passion for building tools that simplify workflows and empower teams. My journey includes **10 years of SaaS development**, automation, and AI-driven solutions.

#### **🏢 My SaaS Journey: app.pilot.pm**
For a decade, I built and ran **[app.pilot.pm](https://github.com/mathieubellon/app.pilot.pm)**, a **project management SaaS** designed to help teams organize, track, and collaborate efficiently. The platform featured:
- **Full-stack architecture**: Python/Django backend, ES6/JavaScript frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Live updates, job queues, and scalable search.
- **Modular design**: Easy to extend for diverse use cases.
After closing the company, I open-sourced the codebase as a resource for developers to learn from and build upon.

#### **🔧 What I Do**
- **Full-Stack Development**: Python (Django), JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and modern frontend frameworks.
- **AI & Automation**: Exploring AI assistants ([clai](https://github.com/mathieubellon/clai)) and productivity tools ([decide-vscode](https://github.com/mathieubellon/decide-vscode)).
- **Open Source**: Sharing knowledge and code to help others learn and build.

#### **🌱 Always Learning**
- **AI integration** in developer tools.
- **Scalable backend architectures** with Go and Python.
- **Productivity systems** for modern workflows.
