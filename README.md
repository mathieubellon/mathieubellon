### **👋 About Me**

I’m **Mathieu Bellon**, a **full-stack developer** and **open-source enthusiast** with a passion for building tools that simplify workflows and empower teams. My journey includes **10 years of SaaS development**, automation, and AI-driven solutions.

#### **🏢 My SaaS Journey: app.pilot.pm**
For a decade, I built and led **[app.pilot.pm](https://github.com/mathieubellon/app.pilot.pm)**, a **B2B SaaS platform** designed for **content marketing and legal teams** to collaborate, produce, and manage content at scale. The platform streamlined workflows by providing:
- **Centralized content production**: Tools for drafting, reviewing, and approving content in a unified workspace.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Live updates, comments, and notifications to keep teams aligned.
- **Automation & scalability**: Job queues, ElasticSearch for fast content retrieval, and Redis for real-time features.
- **Full-stack architecture**: Python/Django backend, ES6/JavaScript frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch.

After closing the company, I open-sourced the codebase as a resource for developers to explore and learn from.

#### **🤖 What I’m Building Now**
I’m currently focused on **LangGraph agents**, preparing for a future where people will **directly "talk" to their data**. My work involves:
- Building **autonomous agents** to interact with data and automate complex workflows.
- Exploring **natural language interfaces** for seamless data access and manipulation.
- Developing tools that bridge the gap between humans and machines, making data more intuitive and actionable.

#### **🔧 What I Do**
- **Full-Stack Development**: Python (Django), JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and modern frontend frameworks.
- **AI & Automation**: Exploring AI assistants ([clai](https://github.com/mathieubellon/clai)) and productivity tools ([decide-vscode](https://github.com/mathieubellon/decide-vscode)).
- **Open Source**: Sharing knowledge and code to help others learn and build.

#### **🌱 Always Learning**
- **AI integration** in developer tools.
- **Scalable backend architectures** with Go and Python.
- **Productivity systems** for modern workflows.
